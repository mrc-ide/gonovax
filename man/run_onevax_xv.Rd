\arguments{
\item{tt}{a numeric vector of times at which the model state is output}

\item{gono_params}{a data frame of parameters}

\item{init_params}{= NULL}

\item{eff}{single numeric indicating efficacy of the vaccine (between 0-1)}

\item{dur}{single numeric indicating duration of the vaccine (in years)}

\item{ve}{single numeric indicating % of population vaccinated before entry
(between 0-1)}

\item{vd}{numeric indicating % of population vaccinated on diagnosis
(between 0-1) a scalar will apply to both activity groups, a vector of
length 2 will apply to each activity group separately}

\item{vs}{numeric indicating % of population vaccinated on screening
(between 0-1) a scalar will apply to both activity groups, a vector of
length 2 will apply to each activity group separately}

\item{t_stop}{time at which vaccination should stop (years)}
}
