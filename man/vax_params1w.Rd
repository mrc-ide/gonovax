\usage{
vax_params1w(dur = 1000, ve = 0, vs = 0, vd = 0, eff = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{dur}{single numeric indicating duration of the vaccine (in years)}

\item{ve}{single numeric indicating % of population vaccinated before entry
(between 0-1)}

\item{vs}{single numeric indicating % of population vaccinated on screening
(between 0-1)}

\item{vd}{single numeric indicating % of population vaccinated on diagnosis
(between 0-1)}

\item{eff}{single numeric indicating efficacy of the vaccine (between 0-1)}
}
\value{
A list parameters in the model input format
currently waning is in stratum 5 (with strata 3:4 unused) for future
compatibility with dualvax, however may get performance boost by moving to
stratum 3
