\arguments{
\item{tt}{a numeric vector of times at which the model state is output}

\item{gono_params}{list of gono params}

\item{init_params}{= NULL}

\item{dur}{scalar or numeric vector with same length as `gono_params`
giving duration of the vaccine (in years)}

\item{vea}{scalar or numeric vector with same length as `gono_params` giving
efficacy of the vaccine against acquisition (between 0-1)}

\item{vei}{scalar or numeric vector with same length as `gono_params` giving
efficacy of the vaccine against infectiousness (between 0-1)}

\item{ved}{scalar or numeric vector with same length as `gono_params` giving
efficacy of the vaccine against duration (between 0-1)}

\item{ves}{scalar or numeric vector with same length as `gono_params` giving
efficacy of the vaccine against symptoms (between 0-1)}

\item{vbe}{scalar indicating pc of population vaccinated before entry
(between 0-1)}

\item{uptake}{scalar or numeric vector with same length as `gono_params`
giving pc of population vaccinated as part of strategy}

\item{strategy}{single character string in "VoD", "VoD(H)",
"VoA", "VoA(H)", "VoD(L)+VoA(H)". Defaults to NULL i.e. no vaccination}

\item{t_stop}{time at which vaccination should stop (years)}
