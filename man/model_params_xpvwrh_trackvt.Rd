\usage{
model_params_xpvwrh_trackvt(
  gono_params = NULL,
  demographic_params = NULL,
  init_params = NULL,
  vax_params = NULL,
  n_erlang = 1,
  n_diag_rec = 1,
  years_history = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gono_params}{A dataframe of natural history parameters}

\item{demographic_params}{A dataframe of demographic parameters}

\item{init_params}{A list of starting conditions}

\item{vax_params}{A vector of vaccination params}

\item{n_erlang}{integer giving the number of transitions that need to be
made through vaccine-protected strata until that protection has waned}

\item{n_diag_rec}{integer for the number of diagnosis history substrata}

\item{years_history}{number of years that diagnosis history is recorded for}
}
\value{
A list of inputs to the model many of which are fixed and
  represent data. These correspond largely to `user()` calls
  within the odin code, though some are also used in processing
  just before the model is run.
