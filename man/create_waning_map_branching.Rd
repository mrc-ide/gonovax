\title{Create mapping for movement between strata due to vaccine waning
where waning from the partially vaccinated stratum (P) moves individuals
back to a naive unvaccinated state (X), and waning from fully vaccinated
stratum (V) moves individuals into a separate waned stratum (W)
Note, this structure is specific to xpvwrh}
\usage{
create_waning_map_branching(n_vax, i_v, i_w, z, n_erlang = 1, n_diag_rec = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_vax}{Integer denoting total number of strata}

\item{i_v}{indices of strata receiving protection through vaccination}

\item{i_w}{Scalar in (0, 6) denoting which stratum receives waned vaccinees}

\item{z}{Scalar denoting rate of waning}

\item{n_erlang}{integer giving the number of transitions that need to be
made through vaccine-protected strata until that protection has waned}

\item{n_diag_rec}{integer giving number of diagnosis history strata}
}
\value{
an array of the mapping
}
