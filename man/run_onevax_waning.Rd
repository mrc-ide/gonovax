run_onevax_waning(
  n = NULL,
  tt,

  dur,
  ve = 0,

  t_stop = 99,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{an integer vector (or value) containing the indices of
corresponding parameter set (1:982). If `n = NULL` the equilibrium positions
for the full parameter set are returned}

\item{tt}{a numeric vector of times at which the model state is output}

\item{eff}{single numeric indicating efficacy of the vaccine (between 0-1)}

\item{dur}{single numeric indicating duration of the vaccine (in years)}

\item{ve}{single numeric indicating % of population vaccinated before entry
(between 0-1)}

\item{vd}{numeric indicating % of population vaccinated on diagnosis
(between 0-1) a scalar will apply to both activity groups, a vector of
length 2 will apply to each activity group separately}

\item{vs}{numeric indicating % of population vaccinated on screening
(between 0-1) a scalar will apply to both activity groups, a vector of
length 2 will apply to each activity group separately}

\item{t_stop}{time at which vaccination should stop (years)}

\item{equilib}{a logical indicating whether to run from equilibrium, default
is `FALSE`, i.e. run from initial conditions}
}
\value{
A list of transformed model outputs
}
