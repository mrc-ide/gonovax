\arguments{
\item{tt}{a numeric vector of times at which the model state is output in
years}

\item{gono_params}{list of gono params for a vaccination trial}

\item{initial_params_trial}{list of initial conditions for model trial. Set
default as NULL.}

\item{dur}{scalar or numeric vector with same length as `gono_params`
giving duration of the vaccine (in years)}

\item{vea}{scalar or numeric vector with same length as `gono_params` giving
efficacy of the vaccine against acquisition (between 0-1)}

\item{vei}{scalar or numeric vector with same length as `gono_params` giving
efficacy of the vaccine against infectiousness (between 0-1)}

\item{ved}{scalar or numeric vector with same length as `gono_params` giving
efficacy of the vaccine against duration (between 0-1)}

\item{ves}{scalar or numeric vector with same length as `gono_params` giving
efficacy of the vaccine against symptoms (between 0-1)}

\item{p_v}{scalar giving proportion of the trial cohort vaccinated, default
is 0.5.}

\item{n_erlang}{integer giving the number of transitions that need to be
made}

\item{stochastic}{logical indicating if the run should be made with the
default deterministic trial model in continuous time or stochastic trial
model in discrete time}

\item{N}{integer to assign the total number of individuals in the trial
(split equally across the two arms)}
