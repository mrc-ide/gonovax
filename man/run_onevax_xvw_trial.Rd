\arguments{
\item{tt}{a numeric vector of times at which the model state is output}

default as NULL.}

\item{dur}{scalar or numeric vector with same length as `gono_params`
giving duration of the vaccine (in years)}

\item{vea}{scalar or numeric vector with same length as `gono_params` giving
efficacy of the vaccine against acquisition (between 0-1)}

\item{vei}{scalar or numeric vector with same length as `gono_params` giving
efficacy of the vaccine against infectiousness (between 0-1)}

\item{ved}{scalar or numeric vector with same length as `gono_params` giving
efficacy of the vaccine against duration (between 0-1)}

\item{ves}{scalar or numeric vector with same length as `gono_params` giving
efficacy of the vaccine against symptoms (between 0-1)}

\item{p_v}{scalar giving proportion of the trial cohort vaccinated, default
is 0.5.}
