}
\arguments{
\item{n_erlang}{integer giving the number of transitions that need to be
made through vaccine-protected strata until that protection has waned}

\item{dh}{integer giving the number of levels of diagnosis history for
each X, V(*n_erlang), and W stratum}
}
\value{
a character vector of length n_vax containing strata labels
}
