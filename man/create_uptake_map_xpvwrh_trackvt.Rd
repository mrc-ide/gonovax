\title{Creates uptake mapping for the branching XPVWRH model where
individuals can move from unvaccinated (X) to vaccinated (V) or partially
vaccinated (P) as well as revaccinated from waned (W) to (R) and, and
partially vaccinated (P) to fully vaccianted (V). The former
reflects the specific indices which are chosen for assigning uptakes.}

dose, becoming partially vaccinated}

vaccine who go on to accept the second dose, becoming fully vaccinated}

a >=1 dose when returning to the clinic due to screening or illness}

a second dose when returning to the clinic due to screening or illness}

\item{booster_uptake}{proportion of the formerly fully vaccinated, waned
population who accept a booster vaccination dose}

\item{idx}{list containing indices of all X, P, V, W, R & H strata and n_vax
through vaccine-protected strata until that protection has waned}

\item{n_diag_rec}{integer for the number of diagnosis history substrata}

an array of the uptakes of same dimensions
